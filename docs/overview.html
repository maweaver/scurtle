	<p><b>Scurtle</b> is a system for working with 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle Graphics</a>.
	Turtle graphics are 2-dimensional line graphics drawn in a relative manner.</p>
	
	<p>Imagine you have a turtle on a canvas, with a paintbrush on his tail.  If his tail is up,
	he is simply <i>moving</i>, and the canvas remains blank.  If, however, the turtle has his
	tail down, he is <i>drawing</i>, and a line is created underneath him as he moves.</p>
	
	<p>The turtle can turn left or right, changing which direction he is facing.  When he next moves
	again, it will be in this new direction.  Unlike 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_geometry">Cartesian Geometry</a>, where each
	point is represented by a set of coordinates, lines in turtle geometry are represented by
	a combination of an angle and a distance, and depend on previous moves.</p>
