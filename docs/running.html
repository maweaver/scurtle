	<h1>Running Scurtle</h1>
	
	<p>Scurtle can be used as a Scala library, allowing the turtle to be controlled directly.  There
	are only a few classes needed to use the Scurtle library:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="scaladoc/com/scurtle/Turtle.html">Turtle</a> - The turtle itself, contains
			methods to move, draw, rotate, etc.</li>
		<li><a href="scaladoc/com/scurtle/Field.html">Field</a> - The field on which the turtle
			moves.  This is a Swing component which can be displayed on a panel.</li>
		<li><a href="scaladoc/com/scurtle/ScurtleApplication.html">ScurtleApplication</a> - Base
			class for application objects.  To create a simple Scurtle app, extend this and define
			a <code>main()</code> method.  A turtle is available in the <code>turtle</code> member
			variable, and a field is available via <code>field</code>.  Once you are done
			manipulating the turtle, call field.repaint() to update the display.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Here is a simple Scurtle application which displays a circle:</p>

	<pre>
object Circle 
extends ScurtleApplication {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    
    def circle(radius: Double, numSegments: Int) {
      val circum: Double = 2.0d * Math.Pi * radius
      turtle.move(radius)
      turtle.rotate(90.0d)
      for(i <- 0 until numSegments) {
        turtle.draw(circum / numSegments.toDouble)
        turtle.rotate(360.0d / numSegments.toDouble)
      }
    }
    
    circle(50, 1000)
    field.repaint()
  }
}
	</pre>	
	
	<p>The more common way is to execute scurtle script files.  These scripts are stored in files
	with a .scurtle extension.  They can be run from the commandline using the Scurtle command:</p>
	
	<pre>
	Scurtle examples/horizontalGradient.scurtle
	</pre>
	
	<p>The Scurtle IDE can be used to interactively create scurtle scripts.  The IDE can be run
	by running the ScurtleIde command.  The Scurtle IDE is more fully described below.</p>

	<h2>The Turtle</h2>
		
	<p>This idea of turtle graphics was built into the programming language
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> in the 1960's.
	It also supported a physical turtle, a small robot to which a pen could be attached, which is
	how the style got its name.</p>

	<p>The turtle in Scala is not a physical one; it lives only inside the Scurtle program.  It
	has the following attributes:</p>
	
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<td>Attribute</td>
				<td>Description</td>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>pos</td>
				<td>The current position of the turtle.  The position is stored internally as a
				pair of cartesian coordinates.  The turtle begins at (0, 0), which is located at
				the center of the field.  His position is updated automatically as he moves through
				the field.  This position can also be set directly, but it is not recommended, as
				this goes against the turtle programming paradigm.<br><br>
				There is no way to set this value through a Scurtle Script.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>color</td>
				<td>The color to be drawn by the turtle during his next move.  This defaults to
				black, but can be set to any
				<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">java.awt.Color</a>
				value.<br><br>
				This value can be set inside of a Scurtle Script using the COLOR command.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>thickness</td>
				<td>The thickness of the line to be drawn by the turtle.  Note that this value is
				specified relative to the distance moved by the turtle, not in terms of pixels.<br>
				<br>
				This value can be set inside of a Scurtle Script using the THICK command.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>alpha</td>
				<td>The amount of transparency applied to the turtle's lines.  A value of 0.0 is
				completely transparent, and 1.0 is completely opaque.<br><br>
				This value can be set inside of a Scurtle Script using the TRANSPARENT command.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>rotation</td>
				<td>The current angle of rotation, in radians.  0 radians is to the right, and they
				move counterclockwise, with 2 * PI being a full rotation.<br><br>
				Note that although the rotation is stored internally as radians, most functions
				such as rotate and point take a value in degrees, with zero degrees being straight
				up.  The current angle in degrees is readable via rotationDegrees.<br><br>
				This value can be set inside of a Scurtle Script using the LEFT, RIGHT, and
				POINT commands.</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td>lines</td>
				<td>As the turtle draws, its movements are stored as a list of lines.  This allows
				the movements of the turtle to be replayed or examined.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
