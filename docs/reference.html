	<h1>Scurtle Script Reference</h1>
	
	<p><b>Note: </b> <a href="scaladoc/index.html">Click here for ScalaDoc reference</a>
	
	<p>These are the commands available from within Turtle Script</p>
	
	<h3>MOVE/DRAW &lt;distance&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Moves the turtle a specified distance in the direction he's facing.  If using DRAW, leaves
	a line; otherwise, simply moves with no visible changes.</p>
	
	<h3>LEFT/RIGHT/POINT &lt;degrees&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Changes the turtle's heading.  LEFT and RIGHT both move the turtle relative to the direction
	he currently faces, and POINT points him in a certain direction, regardless of his previous
	direction.</p>
	
	<h3>COLOR &lt;n|+/-n|color&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Changes the color for the next line.  The color can be set in one of three ways:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><code>COLOR &lt;n&gt;</code> sets the color to one of nine colors:
			<ol start="0">
				<li>Black</li>
				<li>White</li>
				<li>Red</li>
				<li>Orange</li>
				<li>Yellow</li>
				<li>Green</li>
				<li>Cyan</li>
				<li>Blue</li>
				<li>Purple</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><code>COLOR &lt;+/-n&gt;</code> adds <code>n</code> to the current color index to choose
			a new color relative to the existing one.</li>
		<li><code>COLOR &lt;name&gt;</code> sets the color to one of the items in the list above 
			using its name according to the list.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>TRANSPARENT &lt;n|+/-n&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Changes the amount of transparency in the drawing.  Transparency can range from 0 to 100, 
	with 0 being completely opaque and 100 being completely transparent.  Transparency can be set
	to an absolute value by supplying a number, or relative to its current value by prepending a
	plus or minus sign.</p>
	
	<h3>REMEMBER/GOBACK</h3>
	
	<p>REMEMBER stores the turtle's current position and direction, and GOBACK returns to the last
	position.  More than one location can be REMEMBER'd; in this case, GOBACK returns to the most
	recently-remembered position.</p>
	
	<h3>REPEAT &lt;iterations&gt;/NEXT</h3>
	
	<p>The instructions between the REPEAT and NEXT commands are executed <code>iterations</code>
	number of times.  REPEAT commands can be nested.</p>
	
	<h3># &lt;label&gt;/GO &lt;label&gt;/RETURN</h3>
	
	<p>Provides a way to create functions in turtle script.  <code>#</code> labels a location in
	the script.  GO moves the current instruction to the given label, and RETURN resumes execution
	after the GO statement.</p>
	
	<h3>LET &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Assigns a value to a variable.  A variable is a single word which represents a value, and a
	value is a number to assign to it.</p>
	
	<h3>IF &lt;expr1&gt; &lt;comparator&gt; &lt;expr2&gt;/ELSE/ENDIF</h3>
	
	<p>Compares two expressions.  The comparator can be one of <code>&lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;, &gt;=,
	!=.</code>.  If the condition is true, then the lines from the IF to the next ELSE/ENDIF
	statements are executed.  If not, the code from the next ELSE, if present, to the following
	ENDIF is executed.</p>
	
	<h3>PUSH &lt;expr&gt;/POP &lt;variable&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Push stores a value onto the stack.  Pop removes the latest value pushed and stores it in
	a variable.</p> 
	
	<h3>LSRULE &lt;ruleName&gt; &lt;generates&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Creates an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-systems">L-system</a> rule with the
	given name.  If a label is defined, the commands inside that routine define the action of
	the L-system rule.  Generates is a list of rule names to replace this rule in the next
	iteration.  If there is no action for this rule, no corresponding label is needed.  If there is
	only an action, and the rule generates itself, no LSRULE command is needed.</p>
	
	<h3>LSRUN &lt;iterations&gt; &lt;startingRule&gt;</h3>
	
	<p>Runs an L-system for the given number of iterations, starting with the given start rule.</p>
